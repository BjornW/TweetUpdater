Plugin Name: TwitterUpdater
Description: WordPress plugin to update Twitter status when you create or publish a post.
Version: 2.11
Author: Ingo "Ingoal" Hildebrandt, Jordan Trask "@comm", Patrick Fenner
Author URI: http://www.geektank.net/twitter-updater/

TODO for v.3.0

- Add OAuth authentication for twitter, needs 3 steps:
  - Input username. Get request token from twitter.
  - Send user to Twitter and have them ok TweetUpdater to use their account
    - I think they have to go manually, because Twitter will only return to one 
	place per set of consumer keys. 
  - Swap request token for access token
All tokens will need storing in the wp database with the other returned fields.
I suggest these will need doing from the manager page.

- Set the updater code to use the OAuth credentials

- Check compatability with WP 3.0 (works with 2.9.2)

- ZZ.gd broke with 403 forbidden error, fixed with setting different user agent.
- Move menu to "Settings".
- Added option under configuration to choose ZZ.gd or TinyURL. Added 1 function.
- Re-worked the code for url shortening services, change in one place instead of three. Created a function instead.
  which makes it easier to add more services if necessary. Bit.ly support in the future?
