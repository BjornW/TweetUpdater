Description: WordPress plugin to update Twitter status when you create or publish a post.
Version: 3.x.beta1
Author: Ingo "Ingoal" Hildebrandt, Jordan Trask "@comm", Patrick Fenner

TODO for v.3.0
- Check compatability with WP 3.0 (works with 2.9.2)
- Test...

Version 3.x.alpha1:

- Added OAuth authentication for twitter, uses 3 steps:
  1 Set Consumer keys (or use default)
  2 - Get request token from twitter.
    - Send user to Twitter and have them ok TweetUpdater to use their account
    - The user has to return manually, because Twitter will only return to one 
      place per set of consumer keys. 
  3 Swap request token for access token
All tokens are stored in an array in a single entry in wp-options.

- Set the updater code to tweet using the OAuth credentials
