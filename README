- ZZ.gd broke with 403 forbidden error, fixed with setting different user agent.
- Move menu to "Settings".
- Added option under configuration to choose ZZ.gd or TinyURL. Added 1 function.
- Re-worked the code for url shortening services, change in one place instead of three. Created a function instead.
  which makes it easier to add more services if necessary. Bit.ly support in the future?

Edit: - fixed the multi-tweet issue in WP2.6 (due to post revisions the same post was twittered multiple times before)
      - streamlined the options...only new posts and edited old-posts from now on out...
